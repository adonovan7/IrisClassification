# Iris Classification Machine Learning Project

## Overview

This is an extended walk-through of Jason Brownlee's tutorial on machine learning algorithms using Python and the *sklearn* package. I will be adding different techniques, comments, and more in-depth explanations of the different ML algorithms as I go along.

## Data set
The UCI Iris dataset is one of the most common and well-known datasets for practicing Machine Learning. The goal of the project is to predict the type of iris based on the flower's sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width measurements. There are no missing values and the data set is already clean, making it easy to jump right into the machine learning section.

## Algorithms Used:

1. Linear Regression
2. Linear Discriminant Analysis
3. Kth Nearest Neighbor
4. Classification and Regression Trees
5. Gaussian Naive Bayes
6. Support Vector Machines

## Topics Covered:
* Training and test sets
* Cross validation
* Data visualization
* Confusion matrices
* F1 scores (precsion and recall)

## Results: 
Using the Support Vector Machine algorithm, I was able to get 99.2 % accuracy in the classification of iris class
