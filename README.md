# Iris_Classification

## Overview

This is an extended walk through of Jason Brownlee's tutorial on machine learning algorithms using Python and the sklearn package. I will be adding different techniques, comments, and more in-depth explanations of the different ML algorithms as I go along.

## Data set
I used the UCI Iris dataset, which has 4 attributes and 150 observations. The Iris is one of the most common and well-known datasets for practicing Machine Learning because it has clean data with no missing values and a very clear goal, which is to predict the iris type based on sepal length, sepal width, petal lenght, and petal width.

## Machine Learning Algorithms used:

1. Linear Regression
2. Linear Discriminant Analysis
3. KNN
4. Classification and Regression Trees
5. Gaussian Naive Bayes
6. Support Vector Machines

## Topics Covered:
* training and test sets
* cross validation
* data visualization
* confusion matrices
* f1 scores (precsion and recall)

## Results: 
Using the Support Vector Machine algorithm, I was able to get 93.33 % accuracy in the classification of iris class
